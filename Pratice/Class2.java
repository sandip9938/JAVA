        /*
         * 1995 - James Gosling, a researcher at Sun Microsystems in California,
           developed the first version of Java while working on his PhD thesis at Stanford University.
         * He called it "Oak," but later renamed it to Java after seeing an article
           about oaks trees.
         * They are released it as an open source project in February 1996 under the name "Java".
         * The language was aesigned to be platform independent, meaning that it could run on any operating system without modification. 
         * In 1996, Oracle Corporation acquired Sun Microsystems for $7 billion dollars.

         /*
         * JVM is a virtual machine for running Java programs. It allows bytecode 
         executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to run on a system that isn't specifically designed to run it.
         (a low-level platform-independent representation of applications and applets)
         executed by a computer that uses instructions similar to those used by the Intel x86 processor found in most PCs.

         * The JDK contains two parts:
         1) Java Development Kit (JDK): This includes tools such as compilers, debuggers,

        -The Java Development Kit (JDK), which includes tools for developing applications, such as compilers, debuggers, and emulators.
